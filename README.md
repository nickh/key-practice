# Musical Key Practice

I'm learning to play guitar, and wanted a simple way to
work on the muscle memory for chords and scales.

This HTML file is a self-contained practice app that
lets you choose a duration and continuously displays
a random key for that number of seconds.

You can see it in action [here](http://nickh.hengeveld.com/key-practice.html)
